# Security Considerations
#
# The server MUST validate all input parameters to prevent command injection.
# 
# The server MUST handle file paths securely to prevent path traversal attacks.
# 
# The server SHOULD implement rate limiting for resource-intensive operations.
# 
# The server SHOULD implement memory limits for cache storage.
