# Performance Considerations
#
# The server SHOULD optimize cache hit rates for commonly accessed crates.
# 
# The server SHOULD implement concurrent request handling efficiently.
# 
# The server SHOULD minimize the number of cargo command executions.
# 
# The server MAY implement background cache warming for popular crates.
